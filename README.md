# SOIL WebApp

SOIL is a long-term organic food grocer with several store locations around Melbourne, Australia. They focus on premium, organic fresh food. This WebApp serves as SOIL's online presence, allowing customers to shop online, learn about organic produce with tips and tricks, and create customised meal plans based on preferences and dietary requirements.

## Running

This project was built with Node v21.7.1

To run, cd into root directory and run command `npm install` to install dependencies.

The webapp can then be started by running command: `npm start`

The application will be hosted locally on `localhost:3000`, assuming port 3000 is available.
